4. Intervention:
   - Patients in the intervention group received 500 mg azithromycin three times a week for 12 months.
---

5. Comparison/Control:
   - Patients in the control group received a placebo three times a week for 12 months.

6. Follow-up:
   - Length of follow-up: 12 months
   - Loss-to-follow-up: 
     - Placebo group: 11 patients (23.4%) did not have throat samples taken at regular visits due to no permission granted for extra throat swabs.
     - Azithromycin group: 1 patient (2.2%) did not have throat samples taken at regular visits due to no permission granted for extra throat swabs.
   - Incomplete outcome data:
     - Placebo group: At baseline, 36 patients had throat samples taken. At month 6, 30 samples were available. At month 12, 27 samples were available.
     - Azithromycin group: At baseline, 44 patients had throat samples taken. At month 6, 34 samples were available. At month 12, 32 samples were available.

7. Outcome measures and effect size:
   - Prevalence of macrolide resistance genes (ermF and ermB) over time:
     - Baseline:
       - Placebo group: ermF: 44.4% (16/36), ermB: 86.1% (31/36)
       - Azithromycin group: ermF: 59.1% (26/44), ermB: 97.7% (43/44)
     - Month 6:
       - Placebo group: ermF: 43.3% (13/30), ermB: 80.0% (24/30)
       - Azithromycin group: ermF: 67.6% (23/34), ermB: 97.1% (33/34)
     - Month 12:
       - Placebo group: ermF: 48.1% (13/27), ermB: 74.1% (20/27)
       - Azithromycin group: ermF: 68.8% (22/32), ermB: 100.0% (32/32)
   - Loss and acquisition of macrolide resistance genes:
     - No differences in the presence of the mefA gene in the pharyngeal microbiota.
     - Loss of ermB gene was statistically significant higher in the placebo group compared to the azithromycin group (p = 0.012).
   - Relative gene abundances of macrolide-resistant genes:
     - mefA:
       - Month 6: Placebo: -0.22 (n = 27), Azithromycin: 0.51 (n = 34), p = 0.0001
       - Month 12: Placebo: -0.39 (n = 26), Azithromycin: 0.33 (n = 30), p = 0.002
     - ermF:
       - Month 6: Placebo: -0.14 (n = 11), Azithromycin: 0.86 (n = 18), p = 0.0687
       - Month 12: Placebo: 0.15 (n = 12), Azithromycin: 1.04 (n = 17), p = 0.0124
     - ermB:
       - Month 6: Placebo: -0.32 (n = 20), Azithromycin: 0.69 (n = 33), p = 0.0116
       - Month 12: Placebo: -0.42 (n = 18), Azithromycin: 0.89 (n = 30), p = 0.0013

8. Comments:
   - The study showed a high prevalence of macrolide-resistance genes at baseline, which may be due to historical exposure to antibiotics in the study population.
   - The clinical implications of the increased relative abundance of macrolide resistance genes in the azithromycin group are unclear.
   - The study did not culture throat samples to assess changes in the microbiological profile and resistance patterns.
   - The study focused on three specific macrolide resistance genes, but other genes and mutations may also be involved in macrolide resistance.
