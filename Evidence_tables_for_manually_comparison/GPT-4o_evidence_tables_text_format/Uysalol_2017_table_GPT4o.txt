4. Intervention:
   - Group HS: 4 ml of 3% hypertonic saline
   - Group ADR: 4 ml normal saline with adrenaline 0.1 mg/kg
   - Group ADR+HS: 4 ml of 3% hypertonic saline with adrenaline 0.1 mg/kg/dose

   - Incomplete outcome data: 
     - 2 in HS group, 1 in ADR group, 2 in Salbutamol group, and 3 in NS group were excluded during the study due to BCS deterioration worse than 9.

8. Comments:
   - The study did not provide information on funding and conflicts of interest.
   - Loss-to-follow-up and incomplete outcome data were not explicitly stated, requiring inference from participant numbers.
   - The study was not powered to detect differences in secondary outcome measures.
   - The fixed schedule for drug administration may have influenced clinical recovery, but this was not explicitly addressed in the study.
