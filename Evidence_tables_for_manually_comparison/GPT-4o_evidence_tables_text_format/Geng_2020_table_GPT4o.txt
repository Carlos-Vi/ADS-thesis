4. Intervention:
   - Oxygen therapy was performed with an AIRVO-2 respiratory humidified therapeutic apparatus (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Company). Therapeutic regimens were codetermined by two attending physicians, and ventilator therapists with specialized training for more than 3 months were responsible for adjusting the parameters of the high-flow apparatus. Parameter settings for the HFNC apparatus were as follows: initial gas flow of 30–40 L/min; FiO2 titration to maintain pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 92%–96%; blood gas analysis for dynamic adjustment (in case of no proper oxygenation, the inspiratory flow could be increased gradually and FiO2 could be increased up to 100%); temperature range of 31–37°C appropriately adjusted according to patient comfort and tolerance as well as sputum viscosity. HFNC weaning criteria were as follows: HFNC parameters gradually decreased after gradual control of asthma. If the following criteria were met, HFNC weaning was considered: inspiratory flow < 20 L/min and FiO2 < 30%. The flow of HFNC was initially set at 30–40 L/min, and inspiratory flow rate could be increased to 45–60 L/min to achieve the maximum flow tolerated by the patients.

5. Comparison/Control:
   - Conventional oxygen inhalation methods, including nasal cannula, venturi mask, and storage balloon mask, were used. According to the patient’s condition, the appropriate oxygen inhalation mode and oxygen flow were determined. The appropriate oxygen therapy was determined independently by the two attending physicians. Ventilator therapists were responsible for all procedures involved in oxygen inhalation to maintain SpO2 within a range of 92%–96%, and blood gas analysis was combined for dynamic adjustment.

8. Comments:
   - The study did not provide detailed information on loss-to-follow-up or incomplete outcome data.
   - The study showed no significant difference in overall clinical efficacy between HFNC and COT, but HFNC was more efficient in elevating PO2 and reducing HR and RR.
   - The small sample size and single-center design may limit the generalizability of the findings.
   - No follow-up evaluation was conducted to assess long-term outcomes such as recurrence rate of asthma or 90-day mortality rate.
