4. Intervention:
   - NHF was delivered by a high-flow blower-humidifier AIRVO 2 via Optiflow medium-sized high-flow nasal cannula (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand). The initial NHF rate was 35 L/min and could be adjusted from 30 to 60 L/min according to the participant’s level of comfort. FiO2 was adjusted to achieve a steady state SpO2 of 95% to 99% or 90% to 92% if the patients’ baseline SpO2 at room was less than 92%. All participants received standard treatments and interventions, including continued doses of bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroid, and magnesium sulfate if not given prior to reassessment, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and other treatments as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

5. Comparison/Control:
   - COT was given by a standard oxygen nasal cannula or nonrebreather mask. FiO2 was adjusted to achieve a steady state SpO2 of 95% to 99% or 90% to 92% if the patients’ baseline SpO2 at room was less than 92%. All participants received standard treatments and interventions, including continued doses of bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroid, and magnesium sulfate if not given prior to reassessment, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and other treatments as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

6. Follow-up:
   - Length of follow-up: 120 minutes
   - Loss-to-follow-up: None reported
   - Incomplete outcome data: One participant from each group had worsening clinical symptoms and was intubated after initial assessment and before 30 minutes. Therefore, they could not contribute any patient-reported data for the analysis. Their previous MBS and NRS scale scores, all of which were the maximum score of 10, were carried forward to all the following time points after they were intubated for the ITT analysis.

8. Comments:
   - The study was terminated early due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have resulted in larger between-group differences than might have been observed had the study continued to completion.
   - The participants in this study were relatively older than those in previous studies, which may affect the generalizability of the results.
   - The lack of blinding to the devices used may have affected the outcomes measured.
   - The study did not detect changes in management, intubation, and mortality rates, and did not use lung function as an outcome measure.
