   - Characteristics at the beginning of the study:
     - Mean age: 4.2 months
     - Sex: 59.4% boys
     - Clinical score: 4.9±1.0 (all groups)
     - SpO2: 96.0±3.6 (on demand racemic adrenaline), 96.0±3.3 (fixed schedule racemic adrenaline), 96.0±3.4 (on demand saline), 96.1±2.8 (fixed schedule saline)
     - Respiratory rate: 53.1±11.8 (on demand racemic adrenaline), 53.6±10.5 (fixed schedule racemic adrenaline), 53.8±11.3 (on demand saline), 53.4±11.1 (fixed schedule saline)
     - Heart rate: 154.5±17.5 (on demand racemic adrenaline), 156.0±18.7 (fixed schedule racemic adrenaline), 155.2±19.9 (on demand saline), 153.7±17.7 (fixed schedule saline)
   - Groups were comparable at the beginning of the experiment.

4. Intervention:
   - Infants in the intervention group received inhaled racemic adrenaline. The dose was based on the infant’s weight: 0.10 ml for infants weighing less than 5 kg, 0.15 ml for those weighing 5 to 6.9 kg, 0.20 ml for those weighing 7 to 9.9 kg, and 0.25 ml for those weighing 10 kg or more. The medications were diluted in 2 ml of saline before nebulization and were administered through a Sidestream Reusable Nebulizer with a Respironics Facemask, driven by 100% oxygen at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The inhalations were given either on demand or on a fixed schedule (up to every 2 hours).

5. Comparison/Control:
   - Infants in the control group received inhaled saline. The dose was 0.9% saline alone, diluted in 2 ml of saline before nebulization, and administered through a Sidestream Reusable Nebulizer with a Respironics Facemask, driven by 100% oxygen at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The inhalations were given either on demand or on a fixed schedule (up to every 2 hours).

6. Follow-up:
   - Length of follow-up: Until discharge from the hospital.
   - Loss-to-follow-up: 83 children (20.5%) discontinued the study.
     - Intervention group: 36/203 (17.7%) discontinued (12 had treatment failure, 2 had side effects, 4 were withdrawn by parent, 1 was inappropriately withdrawn)
     - Control group: 47/201 (23.4%) discontinued (15 had treatment failure, 1 had side effects, 3 were withdrawn by parent, 1 was inappropriately withdrawn)
   - Incomplete outcome data: Not explicitly stated, but inferred from the number of participants who discontinued the study.

7. Outcome measures and effect size:
   - Length of stay:
     - Inhaled racemic adrenaline: Mean 78.7 hours (range 69.2 to 88.1)

8. Comments:
   - The study found no significant difference in the effectiveness of inhaled racemic adrenaline compared to inhaled saline in reducing the length of hospital stay or other clinical outcomes.
   - The administration of inhalations on demand was found to be superior to a fixed schedule in reducing the length of hospital stay and the need for supportive treatments.
   - There was a significant interaction between age and treatment efficacy, with younger infants showing a longer hospital stay.
   - No serious adverse events were reported, but moderate tachycardia was noted in three children, including one receiving inhaled saline.
   - The study was sufficiently powered to detect a 5-hour difference in length of stay and included a nationally representative patient cohort.
   - The actual time of discharge was used as the endpoint for length of stay due to incomplete recording of the initially planned endpoint.
