4. Intervention:
   - FF/UMEC/VI 100 μg/62.5 μg/25 μg in a single inhaler and placebo (second inhaler); all treatments/placebo were delivered using the ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in the morning.
---

5. Comparison/Control:
   - FF/VI 100 μg/25 μg and UMEC 62.5 μg, in separate inhalers; all treatments/placebo were delivered using the ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in the morning.

6. Follow-up:
   - Length of follow-up: 24 weeks
   - Loss-to-follow-up: Not explicitly stated, but 94% of patients completed the study in each treatment group.
   - Incomplete outcome data: Not explicitly stated, but the mPP population included 478 patients in each group, indicating some data exclusion due to protocol deviations.

8. Comments:
   - The study did not explicitly state the reasons for loss-to-follow-up or incomplete outcome data, but the mPP population numbers suggest some data exclusion due to protocol deviations.
   - The study population was designed to recruit patients with higher disease burden and exacerbation risk, which may account for the higher incidence of adverse events compared to other studies.
   - The study was double-dummy blind, so the impact on adherence of a simplified single-inhaler triple therapy regimen versus the same treatments delivered using two inhalers could not be directly assessed.
