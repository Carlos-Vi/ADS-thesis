4. Intervention:
   - Nebulized 5% hypertonic saline (4ml) or mixed 5% hypertonic saline with standard epinephrine (2ml standard epinephrine + 2ml 5% hypertonic saline) administered for 10 minutes with a small, tight-fitting plastic face mask with an updraft nebulizer with continuous flow of 100% oxygen at 6 to 7 L/min. Infants received nebulizations every 4 hours during the study period.
---

5. Comparison/Control:
   - Normal saline placebo (4ml of normal saline) administered for 10 minutes with a small, tight-fitting plastic face mask with an updraft nebulizer with continuous flow of 100% oxygen at 6 to 7 L/min. Infants received nebulizations every 4 hours during the study period.

6. Follow-up:
   - Length of follow-up: 120 minutes after the start of the first treatment, with additional secondary outcome measure being hospital stay duration.
   - Loss-to-follow-up: 3 patients (3.09%) were withdrawn from the study. Two patients were withdrawn by the pediatric inpatient team due to worsening clinical status during the first 24 hours (placebo group). One patient was withdrawn at parents’ request because they refused hospitalization.
   - Incomplete outcome data: No specific information provided, but 94 patients completed the study.

8. Comments:
   - The study is limited by the small sample size, which may explain the lack of significant differences in outcomes.
   - The study did not provide information on funding and conflicts of interest.
   - The study did not specify the exact number of participants who completed the follow-up for each group, but it mentioned that 94 patients completed the study.
   - The study did not provide detailed information on the exact reasons for the exclusion of the three patients from the statistical analysis.
