4. Intervention:
   - A 6-month cardiac rehabilitation program consisting of physical exercise and psychoeducational consultations plus usual care. The physical exercise program was a 12-week program aimed at increasing exercise capacity, initiated with one mandatory training session at the hospital by trial physical therapists. The following program was offered at a local trial-protocol-certified supervised hospital, the municipality where the patient lived, or home-based training. The training program consisted of graduated cardiovascular training based on intensity prescription using the Borg 15-point scale and strength exercises altered stepwise during training sessions. The psychoeducational consultations aimed to provide emotional support and improve coping skills and illness appraisal to enable the patients to respond appropriately to physical and psychological symptoms. Education and information about AF prepared the patients for expected symptoms. The psychoeducational consultations were inspired by R.R. Parse’s Human Becoming Practice Methodology and complied with recommendations on the use of patient education and psychosocial support in secondary prevention. Patients were offered four consultations face-to-face or by telephone over six months with a nurse.

8. Comments:
   - The study did not find significant differences in mortality or hospital admissions between the intervention and control groups at 24 months. The reasons for loss-to-follow-up and incomplete outcome data were not explicitly stated, which could introduce some bias. Additionally, the study did not account for whether patients were in sinus rhythm or AF during follow-up, which could affect the interpretation of results.
