4. Intervention:
   - The HS Group received 4 mL of NaCl 3% (MucoClear 3%) every 6 hours until discharge. MucoClear 3% is produced by PARI Gmbh (Germany). Pari LC sprint Nebulisers were used with an oxygen flow at 6 l/min. Two mask sizes were available for children aged <1 year or >1 year. Trained nurses administered HS. Standard therapy included suctioning nasal secretions, water-electrolyte balance maintenance, and oxygen supplementation when needed. If any child showed signs of respiratory failure, a nebulisation of 4 mg of epinephrine was given, up to three times within the hour. If there was no response, the patient was admitted to ICU.

5. Comparison/Control:
   - The SC group received standard supportive care with no inhalation. Standard therapy included suctioning nasal secretions, water-electrolyte balance maintenance, and oxygen supplementation when needed. If any child showed signs of respiratory failure, a nebulisation of 4 mg of epinephrine was given, up to three times within the hour. If there was no response, the patient was admitted to ICU.

6. Follow-up:
   - Length of follow-up: Until discharge from the hospital.
   - Loss-to-follow-up: None reported.
   - Incomplete outcome data: Two patients were excluded after randomisation (one for misdiagnosis of pneumonia and the other for decompensation of an unknown neurological disease). This resulted in 120 patients completing the study (61 in the HS group and 59 in the SC group).

8. Comments:
   - The study did not show any beneficial effects of nebulised hypertonic saline (HS) on the length of hospital stay (LOS) in children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. The results are consistent with recent large studies and meta-analyses that also did not support the use of HS in such cases. The absence of blinding is a critical limitation of the study. Additionally, the potential effect of normal saline (NNS) as a placebo in previous studies complicates the interpretation of HS benefits. The study did not control for the duration of illness before hospitalisation, which could be a confounding factor. Treatment with HS was discontinued in 10 patients at parents' request due to infant discomfort with inhalation by face mask.
