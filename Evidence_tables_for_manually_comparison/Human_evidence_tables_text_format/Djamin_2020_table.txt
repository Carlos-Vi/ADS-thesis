3. Patient characteristics

4. Intervention (I)
azithromycin maintenance therapy 
45 patients

---

5. Comparison / control (C)

Placebo 
47 patients

---

6. Follow-up
throat samples (e-swabs)
were collected at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, as
well as during each exacerbation that required admission to the hospital

---

7. Outcome measures and effect size
the presence and relative abundance of specific macrolide resistance genes ermB, ermF and mefA

Real-time PCR

macrolide resistance gene mefA was present in all
available throat samples at all time points

Before treatment, 
prevalence of the macrolide resistance genes ermF and ermB were respectively 44.4% (n = 16/36)
and 86.1% (n = 31/36) in the placebo group (n = 36), and
respectively 59.1% (n = 26/44) and 97.7% (n = 43/44) in the
azithromycin group
After 12months of placebo treatment ermF
and ermB genes were detected in 48.1% (n = 13/27) and 74.1%
(20/27)
