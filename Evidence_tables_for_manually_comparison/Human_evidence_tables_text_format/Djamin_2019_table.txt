2. Study characteristics
RCT

COLUMBUS trial

post-hoc analysis on data from RCT

---

3. Patient characteristics
92 COPD patients with frequent exacerbations (≥3 exacerbations
of COPD in the previous year)

inclusion criteria: age≥18 years, a COPD diagnosis according to the guidelines of the
GOLD and ≥3 exacerbations
of COPD in the previous year that were treated with steroids
and/or antibiotics.

clinically stable
for one month prior to enrolment


---

4. Intervention (I)
azithromycin maintenance therapy, n=47

---

5. Comparison / control (C)

placebo, n=45

---

6. Follow-up
scheduled visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, outpatient department

---

7. Outcome measures and effect size
total number of COPD exacerbations and the number of hospitalizations
due to COPD exacerbations in the year of treatment

exacerbation was defined according to the Anthonisen criteria, requiring treatment with steroids and/or antibiotics.

number of exacerbations:
I: n=84 exacerbations (1.97 per patient)
C: n=129 exacerbations (2.87 per patient)

mean number of exacerbations per patient, subgroups:

Subgroup eosinophils<2,0%
I:  n=2.50
C: n=2.52

Subgroup eosinophils≥2,0%, 
I: n=1.26
C: n=3.17

no data on the uncertainty (95%CI) reported

NB statistical analysis: eosinophils<2,0% was compared to eosinophils≥2,0%,  within subgroups of treated with azithromycin or treated with placebo. 

Other subgroups included in the analyses: sex, age (< 65, ≥65), smoking status, long acting bronchodilators (LABA), long acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), inhalationcorticosteroids (ICS) use during the study, prednisolone use during the study (yes, no), sputum positive at baseline, Creactive protein (CRP) at baseline (< 3 mg/L, ≥3 mg/L), blood neutrophils at baseline (< 63.3%, ≥63.3%), serum proADM (< 0.69 nmol/L, ≥ 0.69 nmol/L), GOLD stage (1-2, 3 and 4), GOLD group (C and D) and home oxygen use during the study.

8. Comments

AIM: to investigate which characteristics of
COPD patients with the frequent exacerbator phenotype predict the
best treatment response to maintenance therapy with azithromycin

original report RCT (Uzun 2014) included in Cochrane review Herath 2018

difference in the presence of current smokers between the azithromycin group (43%) and the placebo group (20%)

cut-off values in order to dichotomize, for blood eosinophils (2.0% of total white blood cell count); For blood neutrophils  we used as cut-off value the median values at baseline (63.3% of total white blood cell count)

Conclusion: a blood eosinophil
count of ≥2.0% predicted a significant better response after treatment with azithromycin compared to placebo
