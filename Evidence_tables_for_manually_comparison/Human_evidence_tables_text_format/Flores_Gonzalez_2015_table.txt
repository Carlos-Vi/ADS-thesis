3. Patient characteristics 2 
Inclusion criteria:
Eligible patients included infants aged under 24 months admitted to Hospital with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis classified as moderate in severity. The diagnosis was based on a first episode of respiratory distress with wheezing and/or crackles, preceded by an infection of the upper airways.

Exclusion criteria:
Infants were excluded
if they had any of the following risk factors: premature birth as defined by the World Health
Organization (< 37 weeks), in infants with an adjusted age of less than 6 weeks at the time of
enrollment, chronic respiratory disease, hemodynamically significant heart disease, immunodeficiency,
and neuromuscular disease. Infants with previous episodes of wheezing or a physician’s
diagnosis of asthma were also excluded. Finally, we also excluded patients receiving
other non-study treatments during hospitalization.

4. Intervention (I)
Patients received nebulized epinephphine (3 ml of a 1:1000 solution), in
3% hypertonic saline (7 mL).

The nebulized solution was administered by means of a mask
using an ultrasonic hospital nebulizer (Shinmed model Sw918) with a frequency of 1.7 MHz and a mist particle size of 1 to 5 μm.

The solutions were administered initially every
4 hours.

Infants received the same standard support (elevation
of the head of bed, supplemental oxygen when oxygen saturation dropped below 94%,
acetaminophen if fever, and a nasal lavage with sterile saline before and after the administration
of the nebulized solution).

5. Comparison / control (C) 3

Patients received nebulized 3% hypertonic
saline (7 mL) plus 3 mL placebo (sterile water).

The nebulized solution was administered by means of a mask

4 hours.

6. Follow-up
Follow-up:
Patients were monitored only until hospital discharge. 

Lost in follow-up:
I: 10/104 lost
- 6 were admitted to intensive care
- 2 were withdrawn by the pediatrician
- 1 was withdrawn by parent
- 1 failed to fulfil inclusion criteria

C: 13/104 lost
- 6 were admitted to intensive care
- 2 were withdrawn by pediatrician
- 3 were withdrawn by parent
- 2 failed to fulfil inclusion criteria


NB: Only those who completed the study were included in the analyses.
I: 94
C: 91

8. Comments
The primary efficacy outcome was length of hospital stay (LOS), defined as the number of days from admission to the time at which the patient fulfilled the study discharge criteria: aWDF score of 3 or less, an oxygen saturation of 97% or more without supplemental oxygen, adequate oral tolerance, and no further need for nebulized therapy.

Authors report no adverse
events (i.e. tachycardia, sweating, pallor, trembling, or hypertension), during hospitalization.
NB: However, patients with such severe adverse events that PICU admission was necessary (6 in each group), were excluded from analyses. 

Group n confusing: figure group data are swapped.

Article conclusion:
Nebulized epinephrine in 3% saline significantly shortens the length of hospital stay of infants with acute moderate bronchiolitis in our setting, where it normally exceeds 4 days, and reduces the risk of a prolonged stay, without any increase in the occurrence of adverse events, when compared with placebo in 3% saline.
