3. Patient characteristics 2 
Inclusion criteria:
The inclusion criteria were clinical signs of bronchiolitis as defined by Court, Med J 1973;49:771-6, an
age of less than 12 months, and an overall clinical score of at least 4 on a scale of 0 to 10. The clinical score was the sum of points allotted, from 0 (indicating normal findings) to 2 (indicating severe illness), for each of the following: general condition, skin color, findings on auscultation,
respiratory rate, and retractions.

Exclusion criteria:
The exclusion criteria were the presence of any serious cardiac, immunologic, neurologic, or oncologic disease or any serious pulmonary disease other than bronchiolitis; more than one previous episode of obstructive airway disease; symptoms of disease of the lower airway (e.g., coughing) for more than 4 weeks; and receipt of any glucocorticoid therapy in the preceding 4 weeks.

4. Intervention (I)
10 ml of racemic adrenaline dissolved in
0.9% saline to form a solution of 20 mg per milliliter.

on demand or on a fixed schedule

The dose administered was based on the infant’s weight: 0.10 ml for infants weighing less
than 5 kg, 0.15 ml for those weighing 5 to 6.9 kg, 0.20 ml for those weighing 7 to 9.9 kg, and 0.25 ml for those weighing 10 kg or more. The medications were diluted in 2 ml of saline before
nebulization and were administered with a Respironics
Facemask.

No other inhaled medications, with the exception of 0.9% inhaled saline could be administered during the period when the infant was participating in the trial. Supportive
therapy and any other treatments were provided
in accordance with routine care.

nebulization and were administered with a Respironics
Facemask.

on demand or on a fixed schedule

No other inhaled medications, with the exception of 0.9% inhaled saline could be administered during the period when the infant was participating in the trial. Supportive

8. Comments
The primary outcome, length of hospital stay, was defined as the time from the first study inhalation until discharge from the hospital.
No serious adverse events were reported. Three
children (including one who was receiving inhaled
saline) discontinued treatment because of moderate tachycardia, which may have been due to the study medication.

Article conclusion: There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay between children treated with inhaled racemic adrenaline and those treated with inhaled saline (P = 0.43). There were also no significant between-group differences in the use of nasogastric-tube feeding, supplemental oxygen, or ventilatory support; clinical scores before and after the first inhalation of the study medication; or the number of children in whom the study medication was discontinued.
