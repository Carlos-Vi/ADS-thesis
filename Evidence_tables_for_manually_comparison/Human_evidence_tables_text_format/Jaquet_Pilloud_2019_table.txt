3. Patient characteristics 2 
Inclusion criteria:
Eligible patients included children aged from 6 weeks up to 24
months coming to the emergency department (ED) with a first
episode of acute bronchiolitis, defined as symptoms of upper
respiratory tract infection in addition to tachypnoea, wheezing
and widespread crackles at auscultation. Further inclusion
criteria were a Wang Score of 5–12 (moderate to severe) on
arrival.

Exclusion criteria:
Exclusion criteria were children with mild bronchiolitis (Wang
Score <5), previous episodes of wheezing, cardiac or chronic
respiratory disease, immunocompromised children, gestational
age <34 weeks and children with critical illness requiring
immediate admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Children
who received RSV immunoglobulin therapy, corticotherapy in
any form in the preceding 2 weeks or bronchodilators within
24 hours prior to presentation, were also excluded.

N total at baseline: 
- 122 were randomized 
- 120 in analyses

Intervention: 
61 randomized, 60 in analyses

Control: 
61 randomized, 60 in analyses

4. Intervention (I)
HS 3% Group received 4 mL of NaCl 3% (MucoClear 3%) every 6 hours until discharge in addition to standard care.

Standard therapy
includes suctioning nasal secretions, water-electrolyte balance
maintenance and oxygen supplementation when needed.

If any child showed signs of respiratory failure including
either persistent major respiratory distress, signs of exhaustion
with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide above >50 mm Hg on the capillary blood gas, a nebulisation of 4 mg of epinephrine
was given.
Nebulised epinephrine could be administered up to three
times within the hour. If respiratory failure continued despite a total of three nebulisations
of epinephrine / in the absence of response, the patient was
admitted to ICU.

5. Comparison / control (C) 3

Standard Care group with no inhalation.

Standard therapy
includes suctioning nasal secretions, water-electrolyte balance
maintenance and oxygen supplementation when needed.

If any child showed signs of respiratory failure including
either persistent major respiratory distress, signs of exhaustion
with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide above >50 mm Hg on the capillary blood gas, a nebulisation of 4 mg of epinephrine
was given.
Nebulised epinephrine could be administered up to three
times within the hour. If respiratory failure continued despite a total of three nebulisations
of epinephrine / in the absence of response, the patient was
admitted to ICU.

6. Follow-up
Length of follow-up:
Readmission rate in the next 7 days following
discharge from hospital was studied.

Loss-to-follow-up:
None

Incomplete data: 
HS was discontinued in 10 patients at parents’ request (sleep preservation (n=5), agitation with the inhalation facemask
(n=5).

Two patients were excluded after randomisation, one for misdiagnosis (pneumonia) and the other for decompensation of
an unknown neurological disease and excluded from the intention to treat analyses.

8. Comments
No serious adverse events were observed (bronchospasm, excessive
coughing, infection, apnoea and cyanosis) during the study.

Authors report: Sixty-one patients were allocated to the intervention group
(HS) and 61 were allocated to the control group (standard care alone). One hundred and twenty patients completed the whole study. 
However, all Tables in article state that the HS group analyses were with n=61 and the standard care group with n=59 => included N is unclear.

Article conclusion: There were no differences in oxygen therapy duration, transfer to ICU, readmission rate or adverse events. Study does not support the use of
HS nebulisation in children with moderate to severe
bronchiolitis.
