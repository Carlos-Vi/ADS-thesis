3. Patient characteristics 2 
Inclusion criteria:
COPD Assessment Test™ (CAT) score ≥ 10 [13, 14];
a post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio
< 0.70; and a post-bronchodilator FEV1 < 50% of predicted
and ≥1 moderate/severe exacerbation in the previous
12 months or a post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 50% to < 80%
of predicted and ≥2 moderate exacerbations or ≥1 severe
exacerbation requiring hospitalization in the previous
12 months.

Exclusion criteria:
a current diagnosis of asthma
(patients with a prior history of asthma were eligible if they
had a current diagnosis of COPD that was the primary cause
of their respiratory symptoms); α1-antitrypsin deficiency; active tuberculosis; other respiratory disorders that were the
primary cause of respiratory symptoms; lung resection surgery
in the previous 12 months; risk factors for pneumonia
(including immunosuppression and neurological disorders
affecting control of the upper airway [e.g. Parkinson’s disease
or myasthenia gravis]; pneumonia and/or moderate/severe
exacerbation that had not resolved at least 14 days prior to
screening; respiratory infections; abnormal findings on chest
X-ray; clinically significant comorbidities; unstable liver or
cardiac disease; and cancer. Patients with a high risk for
pneumonia (e.g. very low body mass index, severely malnourished,
or very low FEV1) were only to be included at
the discretion of the investigator.

4. Intervention (I)
24 weeks of FF/UMEC/VI 100 μg/62.5 μg/25 μg in a single inhaler and placebo (second inhaler). all treatments/placebo
were delivered using the ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in the morning.


---

5. Comparison / control (C) 3

24 weeks of FF/VI 100 μg/25 μg and UMEC 62.5 μg, in separate inhalers. all treatments/placebo were delivered using the ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in the
morning.

7. Outcome measures and effect size 4 
COPD exacerbations rate
Defined as the number of exacerbations.

Effect measure: Risk ratio [95% CI]:
0.91 [95% CI: 0.74 to 1.12]  in favour of fixed triple therapy.

Mortality
n.r.

Quality of life
Defined as the proportion of responders to the SGRQ.

Effect measure: Risk ratio [95% CI]: 
0.98 [95% CI 0.97 to 1.10] in favour of fixed triple therapy.

FEV1
Defined as the between treatment difference in FEV1

Effect measure: mean difference [95% CI]
18 mL [95% CI -13 to 50] in favour of fixed triple therapy. 

Pneumonia
Defined as the number of participants with pneumonia.

Effect measure: Risk ratio [95% CI]:


Serious adverse events
Defined as the number of serious adverse events.

Effect measure: Risk ratio [95% 
Pneumonia: 
0.67 [0.34 to 1.30] in favour of fixed triple therapy.

Other SAEs
0.91 [95% CI 0.64 to 1.30] in favour of fixed triple therapy.

8. Comments
This study showed that single-inhaler FF/UMEC/VI
100 μg/62.5 μg/25 μg was non-inferior to FF/VI 100 μg/
25 μg plus UMEC 62.5 μg based on change from baseline
in trough FEV1 at Week 24 in patients with advanced
COPD. Our findings confirm that single-inhaler triple
therapy with FF/UMEC/VI offers similar efficacy, healthrelated
quality of life, and safety benefits as the same triple
therapy administered using two inhalers.
