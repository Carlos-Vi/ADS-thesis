4. Intervention (I)
Drugs were administered by means of standard hospital nebulizers through a firmly applied face mask with an oxygen flow of 6 liters per minute within 6-8 minutes.

Administration at at 0, 30, and 60 minutes, and every 4 hours thereafter if needed to a maximum of 24 h.


Group 1: 3% hypertonic saline (HS); Group HS was given 4 ml HS

Group 2: nebulized adrenaline (ADR); group ADR received 4 ml NS with ADR 0.1 mg/kg

Group 3: nebulized adrenaline mixed with 3% hypertonic saline (ADR+HS); group ADR+HS received 4 ml HS with 0.1 mg/kg/dose ADR

Group 4: nebulized salbutamol; group Salbutamol had nebulized salbutamol 0.15 mg/kg with 4 ml NS

5. Comparison / control (C) 3

Control Group: normal saline (0.9% NaCl) (NS); group NS was administered 5 ml NS

Administration at at 0, 30, and 60 minutes, and every 4 hours thereafter if needed to a maximum of 24 h.

6. Follow-up
Length of follow-up:
Readmission to the hospital within first 15 days was recorded.

Loss-to-follow-up / incomplete data:
During the study, infants whose BCS had deteriorated worse than 9 were excluded from the study (2 in HS group, 1 in ADR group, 2 in salbutamol group and 3 in NS group). At the end, 378 patients were able to complete the trial

NB: Only those who completed the study were included in the analyses.

8. Comments
Primary outcomes: LOS and Discharge rate.
The study was not powered to detect differences in secondary outcome measures.

Only those who completed the study were included in the analyses.

Criteria for discharge:
Infants were evaluated using BCS at 4-hour intervals and a score less than 3 were considered for discharge decision.

Article conclusion: Nebulized adrenaline mixed with 3% hypertonic saline, as compared with other options, were associated with a significantly higher discharge rate at 4th hours (p<0.001) and shorter length of hospital stay (p=0.039). However, there was no significant difference between options with regard to adverse events, discharge rates at 24th hours, and readmission rates within the first fifteen days.
