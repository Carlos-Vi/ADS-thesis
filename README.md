# Filling in evidence tables with GPT-4o

This repository contains the data and the code used to generate the results contained in my master's thesis. The folder named "Data" contains the human curated evidence tables in Word format divided into a training dataset and a test dataset. The training dataset was used to iteratively improve the prompt given to the LLM and the test dataset to generate the evidence tables that were used to evaluate the results by comparing them with the manually curated ones.

The "Code" folder contains all the Python scripts used. In order to automatically use them we need two folders: one containing the studies in PDF format and another containing the evidence tables in Word format. It is very recommendated that the names of these studies serve to identify them for example using the second name of the first author and the year of publication. Once we have this two folder we follow this steps:

Medical studies in PDF format:
  1. Run the script named pdf_studies2text to transform the PDFs into text format
  2. Run the script compress_text_files to reduce the size of the text files
  3. Run the script GPT-4o_tables_generator to generate the evidence tables from the medical studies in the compresse text format.

After doing this we will have a folder with all the evidence tables generated by the LLM. To compare them with the manually extracte ones we follow these steps:
  1. Run the script split_tables to split the evidence tables extracted by the humans and by the LLM column by column and organize them in the right way.
  2. Run the script numeric comparison to get an excel table with all the relevant numeric metrics column by column.
  3. Run the script text_comparison to  to get an excel with all the text similarities calculated by the different methods column by column.

Finally we can visulize these results using the jupyter notebook visualizations.
